    <h2>About HomeTuitions</h2>
    <p>
      HomeTuitions is a simple and effective platform created to bridge the gap
      between students and qualified tutors. Whether you're a student seeking
      help in math, science, languages, or arts — or a tutor looking to share
      your knowledge — this platform is for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to provide personalized, accessible, and affordable
      education by connecting learners with tutors right in their local area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built with love using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site is designed to
      be lightweight, responsive, and user-friendly. As we grow, we aim to add
      more features like tutor reviews, ratings, and booking systems to enhance
      the learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for being a part of our journey toward better learning
      opportunities for everyone.
